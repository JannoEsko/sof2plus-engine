This is sof2plus-engine made to work with SoF2 1.00.

To run the game as 1.00, you also need the 1.00 game module, which you can find here: https://github.com/JannoEsko/1fxplus/tree/1fxplus-1.00

The engine has minimal changes compared to the 1.03 version of SoF2Plus - the netcode is adjusted to fit 1.00 logic and that is pretty much it.
So far, playtests have shown that the engine operates as it should, so theoretically this could be used to run 1.00 servers.

Do note, that SoF2Plus is not compatible with QVM's and it is not compatible with already existing DLLs, so already pre-existing mods will not work out of box with the engine. There are various changes needed to make it work which you can see in 1fxplus-1.00 branch in the 1fxplus repository.
